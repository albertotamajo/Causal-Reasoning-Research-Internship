# Causal-Reasoning-Research-Internship
- Conducted literature research on Causal Machine Learning, CausalRepresentation Learning, Causal Discovery and Neural-Causal AI.
- Developed a score-based, iterative and Gumbell-softmax-based continuousoptimisation causal discovery algorithm under the assumption of Gaussianstructural equation models with equal error variances. Due to the latterassumption, no interventional data is necessary.
- Developed a variational inference Expectation-Maximisation-like causaldiscovery algorithm from unknown interventions using an LSTM as anautoregressive distribution over the space of DAGs
