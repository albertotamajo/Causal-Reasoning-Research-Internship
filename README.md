# Causal-Reasoning-Research-Internship
- Conducted literature research on **Causal Machine Learning**, **CausalRepresentation Learning**, **Causal Discovery** and **Neural-Causal AI**.
- Developed a **score-based**, **iterative** and **Gumbell-softmax-based continuous optimisation** causal discovery algorithm under the assumption of Gaussianstructural equation models with equal error variances. Due to the latterassumption, no interventional data is necessary.
- Developed a **variational inference Expectation-Maximisation-like** causal discovery algorithm from unknown interventions using an LSTM as anautoregressive distribution over the space of DAGs
